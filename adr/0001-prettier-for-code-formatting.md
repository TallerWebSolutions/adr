Date: 05/02/2020

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Code formatting is a problem when scaling a team. Each developer has his own code styling preferences, causing unconsented code.
We need a tool for normalize our javascript code formatting.

## Decision

Use prettier as the tool for javascript code formatting

## Consequences

- All developers have to stick with one code styling, instead of its own preferences
- Prettier has to be setup in all machines
