# 2. TypeScript

Date: 05/02/2020

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Runtime errors happens pretty often when using JavaScript. As the application grows, we face errors that would not be thrown if we were using a statically-typed language.

## Decision

Use TypeScript when developing frontends and node.js backends

## Consequences

- The whole team does not have confidence how to use typescript with React
- Decrease of development speed

## Related Categories

- Static type checking
